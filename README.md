# coding

Solve it using multiple approaches — such as brute force, optimized algorithm, recursion, dynamic programming, functional style, or using standard library tools — as applicable.

For each approach, do the following:

Write well-commented code with both block comments and inline comments explaining key steps.

Explain the time and space complexity.

Clearly state the advantages and disadvantages of this method.

Explain when or why this approach is ideal (e.g., good for small input, streaming data, easy to debug, etc.).

At the end, provide a comparison summary table of all the approaches:
